 * Represents a user in chat (the message author).

 * - [login] is the lowercase username (changeable by the user).
 * - [displayName] is what's shown in the UI (can include capitalization / unicode).
 * - [color] is the user's chosen Twitch username color as a hex string, or null if default.
 * - [paint] is the 7TV cosmetic overlay for the username, if any. Shadows live inside the paint.
